# KawaiiPlatformer

This is the repository for a platformer game being developed in Unity. 
if you want to see more of it's early developement, look at the CuteAnimePlatformer project, where a lot of early coding and learning took place.
Currently working on level one, which will require more sprites, 1-2 more enemy types, and some work on polishing the scripts.
