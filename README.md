# KawaiiPlatformer

This is the repository for a platformer game being developed in Unity. 
if you want to see more of it's early developement, look at the CuteAnimePlatformer project, where a lot of early coding and learning took place.
Currently working on a check point system so the levels can become a bit longer than they currently are.
